All state government tax collection is covered. A stratified cluster sample of local property tax collectors yields the estimates of property tax. A stratified simple of local tax imposers yields estimates of all nonproperty taxes. For the fourth quarter of 2010, the latter sample, which gives estimates of nonproperty taxes, replaced a nonprobability sample. A five-quarter bridge report, which compares results using the old methodology to results using the new sample and new methodology, accompanies the release of the data for the first quarter of 2012.
