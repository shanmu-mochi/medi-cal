"Source: The Kaiser Family Foundation: State Health Facts, Medicaid Physician Fee Index, 2012. Data from Stephen Zuckerman and Dana Goin, ""How Much Will Medicaid Physician Fees for Primary Care Rise in 2013? Evidence from a 2012 Survey of Medicaid Physician Fees,"" Urban Institute and Kaiser Commission on Medicaid and the Uninsured, December 2012.
Notes: According to the Kaiser Family Foundation; ""The Medicaid fee index measures each state's physician fees relative to national average Medicaid fees. The data are based on surveys sent by the Urban Institute to the forty-nine states and the District of Columbia that have a fee-for-service (FFS) component in their Medicaid programs (only Tennessee does not). These fees represent only those payments made under FFS Medicaid. The Medicaid fee index is a weighted sum of the ratios of each state's fee for a given service to the corresponding national average fees, where the weight for each service was its share of total Medicaid physician spending among all the surveyed services.""",,,,,
